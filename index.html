		<p> Hi! My name is Timlan Wong. I am a senior double majoring in applied mathematics and data science. Funny thing is, I actually came in as a college of chemistry student interested in pre-med. However, I was spending more time in my data science/math classes than my chemistry classes and found out later that those two subjects werer something I enjoyed much more. Later on, I joined a group known as Data Scholars, which got me into data science. </p>

		<p> Ever since then, I have been involved deeply in the data science community on campus. I have worked with the Division of Data Science in many capacities, which include: a Curriculum Development Team Lead for the Data Science Education Program, a Data Science Major Peer Advisor, and a Discovery Program Researcher. I also worked as a Data Analyst for the Residential Services center, where I helped to ensure that freshmen experience is as great as possible! </p>

		<p> If you have any questions for me, feel free to contact me at <b>timlan.wong@berkeley.edu</b> or on my Facebook, GitHub, and LinkedIn below! </p>
