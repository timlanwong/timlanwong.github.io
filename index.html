		<p> Hi! My name is Timlan Wong. I am a senior double majoring in applied mathematics and data science. Funny thing is, I actually came in as a college of chemistry student interested in pre-med. However, I was spending more time in my math classes than my chemistry classes and found out later that math was something I enjoyed much more. Later on, I joined a group known as Data Scholars, which got me into data science. Ever since then, I have been involed deeply in the data science community. I am a team lead for the data science education program at the division of data sciences, a data science major peer advisor, and a discovery program researcher.</p>

		<p> Outside of class, I enjoy listening to music (mostly EDM). Whenver one of my favorite artists has a concert in Oakland or San Francisco, I do not hesitate to buy a ticket to see them. I also enjoy playing basketball on my free time, where I am currently on an IM team. </p>

		<p> If you have any questions for me, feel free to contact me at <b>timlan.wong@berkeley.edu</b> or on any of my social medias below! </p>
