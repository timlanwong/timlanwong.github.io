		<p> I worked as a Data Science Curriculum Development Team Lead for the Division of Data Science and Information at UC Berkeley for a year and a half, creating assignments (homework, labs, projects) for several courses in development. These are the data science courses I have created assignments for with developers. The courses and their respective Jupyter notebooks are linked in each section. </p>

		<p> 
		<b> Number of Developers Led</b>: 1
			<br>
			<b> Description of course</b>: This course is an introduction to statistics and data science, primarily for MPH and undergraduate public health majors, and others interested in public health topics. The course can be divided into three parts: 1) Using R to explore and summarize univariate and bivariate distributions, 2) Central Limit Theorem and Distributions, 3) statistical inference.
			<br>
			<b> Summary of work done</b>: The goal of this lab is to show how to take a sample from a population and how the sample is used to calculate summary statistics to make inference about the population. I utilized birth data for a small state (say Rhode Island) from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm">this</a> link by the CDC. I utilized R to teach students two sampling methods: stratified sampling and the bootstrap and compared the distributions of the birth weights between each method while varying sample size. Finally I gave a note on the central limit theorem to explain why the largest sample's distribution looked normal despite its original distribution of birth weights not being normal.

			<b> Summary of work done</b>: Updated existing labs to incorporate feedback from last course iteration. Incorporated autograder/tests for immediate student feedback on code.

		<b> Number of Developers Led</b>: 4
		<br>
		<b> Description of course </b>: This course (1) provides a basic intro to census and economic data collection, processing, and analysis; (2) surveys mapping techniques in planning; (3) demonstrates the uses of real-time urban data and analytics; and (4) provides a socio-economic-political context for the smart cities movement, focusing on data ethics and governance
		<br>
		<b> Summary of Work done </b>: Created four Jupyter notebook lab assignments for the course. After creating them, we trained the GSIs who did not have any experience with coding and ensured that they would be able to teach the notebooks in front of their students while we served as lab assignments walking around in case people needed assistance. The following are the labs and their descriptions. Click on the lab links to see what my team and I created for each lab.

		<b> Link to Jupyter Notebook </b>:
			<br> <a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/CP-101-student/tree/master/Lab7"> <b> Lab 7-Intro to Python</b></a>: In this lab, we taught students what Python was from scratch (for loops, lists, list comprehensions, plotting) and went over some of the most popular Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.
			<br> <a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/CP-101-student/tree/master/Lab8"> <b> Lab 8- Webscraping</b></a>: In this lab, we taught students how to use Twitter's API to download tweets to get some experience working with larger datasets.
			<br> <a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/CP-101-student/tree/master/Lab9"> <b> Lab 9-Intro to GeoPandas</b></a>: In this lab, we taught students how to use python and Jupyter notebooks to learn the basics of working with geospatial data in geopandas to create basic maps with the geometry of a location that has information on latitude and longitude coordinates and census tract.
			<br> <a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/CP-101-student/tree/master/Lab10"><b> Lab 10 - Big data</b></a>:  In this lab, we summarized the concepts from the previous three labs while working with a large dataset and learning new pandas operations such as sort and groupby.</p>

			<br>
			<b> Summary of work done</b>: The project was focused on international migration flows. The goal is for students to become “experts” on one assigned country’s migration flows. This is part of a larger project that includes historical migration research. In regards to the datasets, we used a list of 20 countries that are part of our sample from the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates17.shtml">United Nations Data</a> website. This dataset includes longitudinal data – all data available for selected countries from 1990-2017. The data provided to my developers and I by the professor included 3 Microsoft Excel files with multiple sheets. For the end product, we employed a lot of data cleaning and writing scripts/functions in Python to combine the three data excel files into one data file only for students to use. See <a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/IAS-150/blob/master/IAS-150_notebook.ipynb">here</a> for the Jupyter notebook that we created.

			<b> Description of course</b>: The goal of this course is to provide students with an introduction to the community and economic development field, and to develop their ability to think critically and creatively about the policies that are needed to create inclusive, vibrant, and healthy communities.
			<br>
			<b> Summary of work done</b>: Defined the concept of correlation (high-level; no equations) and explain the difference between positive, negative, and no correlation. Looked at correlation coefficient values and scatter plots with best-fit regression lines and say if/how two variables are correlated. Said how redlining “grades” correlate with neighborhood conditions in 2017. Explained how quantitative data is transformed into qualitative assessments about gentrification. Discussed biases and assumptions in evaluating gentrification. Identified which neighborhoods experienced gentrification or decline from 2000 to 2017 based on particular measurements of gentrification, and which continue to need community development investments.

		<b> Number of Developers Led</b>: 2
			<br>
			<b> Description of course</b>: This course explores the causes and consequences of inequality in the U.S. First, we will discuss theories and concepts scholars use to understand inequality. We then consider several institutions that sustain, reproduce and/or mitigate inequality in the U.S., such as education, labor markets, family structure, and the criminal justice system. Within each topic, we pay attention to the significance of race and ethnicity, social class, and gender.
			<br>
			<b> Summary of work done</b>: Students gathered data from different parts of the bay area and entered it onto a google form from their assigned census tracts. We assisted them with exploring the class data and quantify the observations using Python. We visualized how their responses mapped out over the census tracts using the folium library to map their observations onto a map of the census tracts, and include popups with their comments and photos. Next, we sorted the data according to income level. We had students compare the income levels to the level of social disorder and amenities based on the Choropleth visualizations. Lastly, we used linear regression to make a graph that will show the best fit line that correlates to the data.
