		<h1> <p style = "font-size: 20px;"> <b> CP 101- Introduction to Urban Data Analytics </b> </h1> </p> </h1>
		<p> For this course, I led a group of 4 developers to create four lab assignments in Jupyter notebooks. After creating them, we trained the GSIs who did not have experience with coding and ensured that they would be able to teach the notebooks in front of their students while we served as lab assignments walking around in case people needed assistance. The following are the labs and their descriptions. Click on the lab links to see what my team and I created for each lab. </p>

	<div id = "Lab7">
			<br> <a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/CP-101-student/tree/master/Lab7"> <b> Lab 7-Intro to Python</b></a>: In this lab, we taught students what Python was from scratch and went over some of the most popular Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.
		</div>
		<div id = "Lab8">
			<br> <a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/CP-101-student/tree/master/Lab8"> <b> Lab 8- Webscraping</b></a>: In this lab, we taught students how to use Twitter's API to download tweets to get some experience working with larger datasets.
		</div>
		<div id = "Lab9">
			<br> <a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/CP-101-student/tree/master/Lab9"> <b> Lab 9-Intro to GeoPandas</b></a>: In this lab, we taught students how to use python and Jupyter notebooks to learn the basics of working with geospatial data in geopandas.
		</div>
		<div id = "Lab10">
			<br> <a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/CP-101-student/tree/master/Lab10"><b> Lab 10 - Big data</b></a>:  In this lab, we extended our Pandas and Geopandas knowledge to manipulate and visualize an existing large dataset. It incorporates everything we have done in the previous labs.
