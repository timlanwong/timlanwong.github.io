		<b> <u>Database Design Project for UC Berkeley Division of Data Science and Information: IEOR 115 - Industrial and Commercial Data Systems (Fall 2019)</u> </b>
	</div>
	<div id="DatabaseDesc">
		<p><b> Description of Project</b>: In this project, I worked with <b>8</b> other students to work on a project in which we chose a client to work with for the semester. We chose the Division of Data Science and Information at UC Berkeley as a client, and we wanted to build a relational database model for the division's Global Adoption Team. This team is in charge of spreading Data 8 curriculum to other universities (including international) and records all the transactions between us and the university. The <b> problem</b> is that most of the information is tracked on a google form, which is not very scalable. We wanted to find a way to make sure they have faster process management for such information. Therefore, we developed a relational database model in order to provide them with a concise way of storing all their information and optimizing their cost efficiencies.
		<br>
		<b> Methods</b>: <b>SQL, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, Microsoft Access, Microsoft PowerPoint</b>

		<b><u> Predicting Salaries of Baseball Players: Stat 151A (Fall 2019)</u> </b>
	</div>
	<div id = "BaseballDesc">
		<p><b> Description of Projects</b>: For this project, I used data from 2012 baseball season from Sean Lahmann's database. It does not include pitchers and post season results. The goal of this project is to predict/model salaries of baseball players.
			<br>
		<b> Methods </b>: I utilized transformations to symmetrize dostributions and stabilize variance and cleaned the data removing records with no salary information. I found the 10 best models for each model size using the <b>regsubsets()</b> function from the leaps package. I used <b>BIC</b> to select the best 5 models of varying sizes and ranked the models by BIC. Next, I used <b>10-fold cross validation</b> to also rank the 5 models. Finally, I used <b>Lasso</b> to fit the model instead. I compared the <b>CV MSE</b> from the 10-fold cross validation with the 5 models I chose before.
		<br>
		<b> Result </b>: I found that Lasso does a better job at predicting salary than the 5 models. I will try other methods such as Ridge Regression to see if more accurate results at predicting salary are achievable.

		<b> <u>Portfolio of Investments on Predicting Company Stock Price Growth: UGBA 147 - Advanced Business Analytics (Summer 2019)</u> </b>
	</div>
	<div id = "PortfolioDesc">
		<p><b> Description of Project</b>: For this project, we were given a total investment of $1,000,000, distributed among 1,000 specific companies, made in quarter 4 of 2016. We were to build and evaluate a model based on the 2016 + 2017 data that predicts company stock price growth from quarter 4 of year 2016 to quarter 2 of year 2017 and recommended a business solution in the form of a portfolio of investments in companies that maximizes 6-month return.
		<br>
		<b> Methods</b>: First, used <b>PCA and clustering methods such as GMM, K-means, and Hierarchical agglomeration(with complete linkage)</b> for data exploration. Next, I utilized predictive analytic methods such as <b>SVM, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and KNN</b> to predict growth and build confusion matrices for each.
		<br>
		<b> Result </b>:In the end, I saw that Naive Bayes gave the best prediction of all the methods. I am in the process of continuing the project and trying other methods such as <b>Ensemble Methods</b> to get better results.

		<b><u> Goodness of Fit of Fitting Rayleigh Distribution: Stat 135 - Concepts of Statistics (Fall 2017)</u> </b>
	</div>
	<div id = "Stat135Desc">
		<p><b>Description of Project</b>: A series of experiments (Sachs et al., 1995; Yokota et al., 1995) were conducted to learn more about spatial organization on larger scales. Pairs of small DNA sequences (size about 40 kbp) at specified locations on human chromosome 4 were flourescently labeled in a large number of cells. The distances between the members of these pairs were then determined by flourescence microscopyThere has long been a tradition in chemistry of modeling the configurations of polymers by the theory of random walks. As a consequence of such a model, the two-dimensional distance should follow a Rayleigh distribution. The goal of this project is to fit the Rayleigh distribution to some of the experimental results and examine the goodness of fit. The entire data set comprises 36 experiments in which the separation between the pairs of flourescently tagged locations ranged from 10 Mbp to 192 Mbp. In each such experimental condition, about 100â€“200 measurements of two-dimensional distances were determined. This project will be concerned just with the data from three experiments (short, medium, and long separation)
		<br>
		<b> Methods </b>: <b>Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Method of Moments for a sample from a Rayleigh distribution, generation of random variables, histograms, bootstrapping</b>
		<br>
 <b>Result </b>: I found that the interval of the bootstrap vs. the interval with the large sample theory appear to be considerably different. This is evident because the two methods use a different sample size. They sample from the data with different sampling methods and work with the samples in different ways.
